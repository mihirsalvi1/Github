Developmental Models: GitHub primarily follows an open-source development model, allowing developers from around the world to collaborate on projects by contributing code, reporting issues, and suggesting improvements.Many projects on GitHub follow the "fork and pull request" model, where contributors fork a repository, make changes, and then propose those changes back to the original project via pull requests.

Licensing: GitHub repositories can have various licenses, ranging from open-source licenses like MIT, Apache, and GPL to proprietary licenses. The choice of license is determined by the project owner and impacts how others can use and contribute to the code.

Modes of Funding: GitHub itself is a Microsoft-owned platform and offers various services, including free public repositories and paid plans for private repositories.Some open-source projects on GitHub rely on funding through platforms like Patreon, GitHub Sponsors, or corporate sponsorships. These funds support project maintainers and development.

Commercial vs. Non-Commercial: GitHub is used for both commercial and non-commercial projects.Commercial organizations often use GitHub for private repositories to manage their proprietary code.Non-commercial projects include open-source software, educational resources, and personal projects shared with the community.
